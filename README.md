# datasets
This repo is a library of content (mainly icons and images) that can be referenced in Ona's reports and dashboards. 

Notes on style:
* Only non-copirighted content belongs here, so please do not upload anything unless you are sure it can be used and shared. 
* Consider this place as a library. Like all libraries, as it grows it will require more organizing. For now, try to keep it tidy and name things in a way that makes it easy for other to reuse.
* Filenames should be unique and without spaces. It makes for cleaner URLs.

If you have other thoughts / suggestions, please reach out to Ale or Dickson.
